# Unity Movement & Collision Demo

## Project Description

This Unity project demonstrates basic player movement and interactive object behaviors using C#. The player can move around the scene, interact with objects, and receive feedback based on collisions. The project is ideal for beginners learning Unity scripting, physics, and input handling.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Move the player using arrow keys or WASD.
- **Object Interactions**:
  - **Spinner**: Rotates objects continuously.
  - **Dropper**: Objects appear and fall after a delay.
  - **ObjectHit**: Changes color when hit by the player.
  - **Scorer**: Tracks and displays the number of collisions.
- **Debug Instructions**: Console messages guide the player at game start.

## How to Play / Controls
